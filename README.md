Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering process
mastering complexity
Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
design - building the framework.
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification.
 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data
prompt engineering - is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
